# Ramp up

1. [Read](https://medium.com/system-weakness/hitchhikers-guide-to-building-a-distributed-filesystem-in-rust-the-very-beginning-2c02eb7313e7) more about the project
2. Become familiar with the [concepts and features](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs)
3. Understand the [layers](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs/blob/main/website/resources/layers.png)
4. [Quickly start](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs#give-it-a-quick-try-with-docker) the project in Docker
5. Or run it as [CLI](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs?tab=readme-ov-file#command-line-tool) app
6. Build from [source](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs?tab=readme-ov-file#locally) and start it. In case you don't have Linux you can [develop inside a container](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs?tab=readme-ov-file#developing-inside-a-container).
     This will start a new Linux container and remotely connect the local IDE to the container, you can also connect with IDE's terminal to it and run the code. Or on Windows you can use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
7. Then run and understand the [examples](examples). You can even write some new ones to better understand the flow and code, if you do, please create a `PR` back to the parent repo targeting the `main` branch to include those for others too
8. Become familiar with some [tests](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs/blob/main/src/encryptedfs/test.rs). You can even write some new ones to better understand the flow and code, if you do, please create a `PR` back to the parent repo targeting the `main` branch to include those for others too
